# DenverCrimeTracker

Using Denver Police GPS crime data the application will apply quadratic hotspotting to a google map coloring areas where crime is likely to occur based on time and location. The coloring will vary in levels of intensity. This will require using a spacial statistics technique that is frequently applied to crime data called the nearest neighbor index or average nearest neighbor distance. The algorithim will identify which crime data points are clustered. I hope to define current crime problems areas and refine an algorithim to predict where future crimes will occur.
