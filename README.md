# Denver Crime Tracker

Using Denver Police GPS crime data the application applies quadratic hot spotting to a Google map, coloring areas where crime is likely to occur based on time and location. An API gathers all the crimes at a particular time and determines where they fall on the map. A heat map is then applied to map quadrants where further crime analysis is done.

## Project
Completed as a student at Galvanize in Denver, Colorado. The requirements were to build a front-end JavaScript application. Also included are jQuery and AJAX which makes calls to an API I built in PHP. The API is based on .csv data from the [Denver Police Department](https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/police-department/crime-information/crime-statistics-maps.html)
