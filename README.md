# DenverCrimeTracker

Using Denver Police GPS crime data the application will apply quadratic hotspotting to a google map, coloring areas where crime is likely to occur based on time and location. An algorithm splits the Denver area into quadrants of a user specified size. An API call gathers all the crimes at a particular time and analyzes where they fall on the map. A heat map is then applied to the map and individual quadrants run further data analysis. I hope to define current crime problems areas and refine an algorithim to predict where future crimes will occur.
